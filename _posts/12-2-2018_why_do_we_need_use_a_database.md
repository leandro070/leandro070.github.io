> A **database** is an organized collection of data.

The databases organize our data and maintain relationships between them in order to facilitate effective information sharing across an organization.

##So... Why use a database?

1. It is **very quick and easy** to find information.
2. Databases can store very large numbers of records **efficiently**.
3. Avoid data **duplication** and reduced data **redundancy**.
4. Many people can access the same database at the same time.
5. You can setup the permissions on different levels where only specified users can add, update or delete the data.
6. The data in a database can be encrypted for **security** and it is more secure that a paper file or a Excel table.
7. Facilitated development of new applications program.
8. Due to backup and recovery options database can survive in crashes without corrupting the data.
